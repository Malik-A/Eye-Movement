# Eye Movement
## Javascript Exercise
Project created to help test new skills learned in Javascript and CSS. This project opens a screen with eyes that follow the user's cursor. Users can use this code to create their own version of this exercise. In this version of the eye tracker I've updated the code from a green background to a lavendar background.
